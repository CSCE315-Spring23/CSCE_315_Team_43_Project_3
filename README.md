Maven is a Java software development build tool that must be installed.
Instructions are [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)

## Run Instructions

1. Navigate inside the `smook` directory

2. To build and run the backend, run `mvn spring-boot:run`.
_Note: on a first run, do `mvn clean install` to ensure the dependencies are installed correctly._

3. To run the frontend, navigate to the `frontend/smook_app` folder and run `npm run dev` to run a live server in development mode.
All of your local changes will be automatically updated/reflected in the live server.
